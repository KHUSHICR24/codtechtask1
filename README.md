1. Data Import and Preparation
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy
Load the dataset using pandas (e.g., pd.read_csv()).
Check for missing values and data types using methods like .info() and .describe().
2. Data Cleaning
Libraries Used: pandas
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
Remove duplicates and correct inconsistencies (e.g., date formats).
3. Data Visualization
Libraries Used: matplotlib, seaborn
Create visualizations to understand distributions (e.g., histograms, box plots).
Use scatter plots to identify relationships between variables (e.g., delays vs. distance).
Employ heatmaps for correlation matrices to find relationships among features.
4. Feature Engineering
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy
Create new features from existing ones (e.g., extracting day, month from dates).
Categorize continuous variables (e.g., flight delays into bins).
5. Summary Statistics
Libraries Used: pandas
Generate summary statistics for numerical features (mean, median, mode).
Group by categorical variables (e.g., airline or destination) to analyze performance metrics.
6. Advanced Analysis
Libraries Used: statsmodels, scikit-learn
Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests for delay comparisons).
Use clustering algorithms to segment airlines or flights based on performance.
7. Documentation and Reporting
Libraries Used: Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib
Document findings with visualizations and markdown explanations.
Export results or visualizations to share with stakeholders.
